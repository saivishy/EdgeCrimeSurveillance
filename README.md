# Real-Time Surveillance Based Crime Detection for Edge Devices
This repository consists of the code for the paper titled as "Real-Time Surveillance Based Crime Detection for Edge Devices" which has been accepted for presentation at the 15th International Conference for Computer Vision Theory and Applications (VISAPP), Valleta, Malta. [DOI: 10.5220/0008990108010809](https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2020/89901/89901.pdf)

The paper discusses about an efficient real-time deployment of crime detection in surveillance systems. The datasets used are:
* [UCF-Crime](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/projects/real-world/)
* [Peliculas Movie Dataset](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0120448)

Furthermore, this paper adapts and reuses code from [Microsoft Research's EdgeML repository](https://github.com/microsoft/EdgeML).
